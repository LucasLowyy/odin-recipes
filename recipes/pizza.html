        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go!! It yields a soft, chewy crust. For a real treat, I recommend you use bread flour and bake it on a pizza stone, but all-purpose flour works well too. Enjoy! </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medi
                um bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand
                 until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until 
                smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or
                 roll into a round. Transfer crust to a lightly greased pizza pan
                  or baker's peel dusted with cornmeal. Spread with desired toppings 
                  and bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown
                  . Let baked pizza cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
